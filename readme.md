# Audio Visualizer
Welcome to my repository for an audio visualizer I'm working on! This contains a desktop application written with C, mostly using Allegro 5 (and FFTW3), intended to be a full-fledged audio player on completion. Code has been written for both time-domain and frequency-domain visualizations, and I'm currently working on a particle system that will be the backbone of the visualizations.

## Planned Features
- Playlists
- Like, 12 different visualizations
- Usage of shaders for visualizations
- Be able to change audio files......
- Proper user interface......
- (MAYBE) a scripting engine for visualizations?
- Probably DLL support for visualizations...
